			<h2>Pharmaceutical Projects</h2>
				<h3>COVID-19 Therapy</h3>
				<p>During my time as a Compliance Specialist at Takeda Pharmaceuticals, the COVID-19 pandemic halted the world. As the medicine produced was a form of antibodies, our scientific teams were confident we could use it to combat the pandemic. Very quickly a team was put together to design the process of extracting antibodies from the patients who recovered from the viral infection. I consider myself lucky to be a part of the team.
				</p><p>
				I led the compliance initiative to ensure the clinical trial material we produced in our labs was GMP approved and compliant with the FDA CFR 21 guidelines. This was a challenging task as we transformed a research lab into a GMP-certified manufacturing facility. This covered the facility set-up, cleaning validation, environmental monitoring, material approvals, facility validation, process validation, production oversight, and managing any process deviations with appropriate corrective and preventive measures implementation. The project was on a tight timeline, and I am proud that our team was able to meet every milestone.
				</p>
				<h3>Onboarding new Equipment</h3>
				<p>In this project, I led the successful onboarding of a new piece of manufacturing equipment designed to enhance process control and efficiency. I collaborated with engineering, quality, and operations teams to validate the equipment, establish operating parameters, and integrate it into existing workflows. The implementation resulted in a 10% yield recovery, translating into significantly more product delivered per batch. Additionally, by improving process precision and material utilization, the project achieved a 50% reduction in production waste. This not only improved cost efficiency but also supported the company’s sustainability goals by reducing disposal needs and raw material consumption.
				</p>
				<h3>Process Optimization</h3>
				<p>I contributed to a process optimization initiative where we critically evaluated a multi-step manufacturing procedure. By redesigning workflows and applying process engineering principles, we successfully combined four steps into two streamlined steps without compromising product quality or regulatory compliance. This innovation reduced overall production time by 30%, allowing the facility to increase throughput and shorten lead times. Beyond time savings, the simplified process lowered the risk of deviations, improved operator efficiency, and reduced utility usage, supporting both operational excellence and environmental stewardship.
				</p>
			<h2>Development Projects</h2>
				<h3>Web Development</h3>
				<p>I designed and developed a personal portfolio website to showcase my academic and professional work. The project involved building responsive web pages using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a focus on clean design and user-friendly navigation. Throughout the development process, I actively researched how to implement new features, such as interactive menus, embedded images, and hover effects, to enhance the site’s functionality and visual appeal. By exploring documentation, online resources, and community forums, I gained hands-on experience in problem-solving and self-directed learning. This project not only strengthened my technical skills but also demonstrated my ability to adapt and incorporate modern web development practices into real-world applications.
				</p>
				<h3>Backend Development</h3>
				<p>As a backend developer, I worked on creating a student course management system that allowed users to register for courses, track progress, and manage schedules. I built the backend using Java for core logic and SQL for database operations, ensuring efficient handling of course data, student records, and enrollment transactions. To improve usability, I developed RESTful APIs that connected the backend to a simple front-end interface, enabling smooth data exchange. I also integrated Python scripts to automate data validation and reporting tasks.
				</p><p>
				Throughout the project, I focused on database optimization by designing normalized schemas and writing efficient queries to reduce redundancy and improve performance. I researched solutions for common challenges such as concurrency control and transaction management, which gave me deeper insight into handling real-world backend complexities. This project strengthened my skills in server-side programming, database design, and API development, while also improving my ability to troubleshoot and optimize backend workflows.
				</p>
				<h3>Data Analysis</h3>
				<p>As a data analyst, I completed a project focused on analyzing a company’s historical sales data to identify performance trends and growth opportunities. Using SQL, I extracted and cleaned raw data from multiple tables, ensuring accuracy by handling missing values and removing duplicates. I then used R for statistical analysis and data visualization, applying tools such as dplyr for data wrangling and ggplot2 for creating clear, insightful charts.
				</p><p>
				Through this analysis, I identified seasonal sales patterns, highlighted underperforming regions, and uncovered correlations between product categories and revenue growth. I summarized these findings in an R Markdown report, combining narrative, data tables, and visuals into a reproducible format for stakeholders. The project improved decision-making by providing actionable insights that supported targeted marketing campaigns and inventory planning.
				</p><p>
				This experience strengthened my ability to turn raw data into business intelligence, enhanced my skills in SQL and R, and improved my communication of complex results to both technical and non-technical audiences.
