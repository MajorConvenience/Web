				I am a pharmaceutical manufacturing scientist transitioning into the world of computer science.
				With years of experience in process development and quality systems, I have learned the value of precision, problem-solving, and innovation.</p>
				Pharmaceutical manufacturing science process development ensures that laboratory drug discoveries become safe, effective, and commercially viable medicines. It begins with assessing a compound’s stability, solubility, and dosage needs, followed by creating scalable methods for synthesis or biologics production. Central to this work is Quality by Design (QbD), which links product quality to process controls, supported by risk assessments, design of experiments, and real-time monitoring through process analytical technology (PAT). Successful technology transfer and strict compliance with Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) are vital. Increasingly, sustainability, automation, and digital tools drive efficiency, making high-quality medicines more accessible worldwide.

			The fusion of computer science and pharmaceutical research is set to transform the future of healthcare. Advanced computational tools such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and big data analytics enable faster drug discovery, predictive modeling of disease pathways, and optimization of clinical trials. Bioinformatics and computational chemistry accelerate the identification of drug candidates while reducing costs and risks. Meanwhile, digital twins, automation, and smart manufacturing enhance process control and efficiency. By integrating these disciplines, researchers can personalize treatments, shorten development timelines, and improve access to innovative medicines—ushering in a new era of precision, efficiency, and global health impact.
